## Project description
Children undergoing MRI scans can often feel anxious and restless, leading to movement artifacts and the potential need for sedation during the procedure. To enhance patient experience and reduce the need for sedation, we created Mission Control, an immersive VR simulation that simulates a rocket landing to prepare children for the MRI process. After familiarizing themselves with the MRI room and scanner, children board their spaceship and observe the launch and landing through a window. To successfully land, they must focus on the target, keep their head still, and follow visual and audio cues to minimize head movement and safely reach the moon.

## Technologies/features used
We created a Virtual Reality environment with the Unity Game Engine designed for the Oculus Quest 2, Quest 3 (HTC, Pico, etc., need to be tested but they might be compatible as we used OpenXR).

## Assets/dependencies
While the source code is available here, most of the 3D models have been omitted to comply with the licenses and usage rights granted at the time of purchase. Below are examples of assets essential for reproducing our MRIVR, which have been excluded to adhere to these regulations.
